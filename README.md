## Introduction
`Facial_Recognition` is an automatic attendance system that leverages facial recognition technology to mark attendance. It can detect and recognize faces in real-time or from images and videos, making it ideal for schools, offices, and other organizations.

---

## Features
✨ Automatic attendance marking using facial recognition  
✨ Real-time facial detection from webcam feed  
✨ Image and video file face recognition  
✨ High accuracy with pre-trained models (Haar Cascade, Dlib, or CNN-based models)  
✨ Easy integration with existing attendance systems  

---

## Usage
### Real-time Attendance Marking
Run the main script to start real-time facial recognition and automatic attendance marking:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Attendance from Image Files
```bash
python recognize_image.py --image path/to/image.jpg
```

### Configuration
Modify `config.py` to customize settings (e.g., input source, recognition model, attendance data storage, etc.).

---

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.9+  
- OpenCV  
- Dlib  
- TensorFlow/Keras (optional for deep learning models)  
- SQLite/MySQL for attendance data storage
