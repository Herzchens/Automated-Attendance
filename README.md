`Facial_Recognition` is an automatic attendance system that leverages facial recognition technology to mark attendance. It can detect and recognize faces in real-time or from images and videos, making it ideal for schools, offices, and other organizations.

---

## Features (pending)
✨ Automatic attendance marking using facial recognition  
✨ Real-time facial detection from webcam feed  
✨ Image and video file face recognition  
✨ High accuracy with pre-trained models (Haar Cascade, Dlib, or CNN-based models)  
✨ Easy integration with existing attendance systems
